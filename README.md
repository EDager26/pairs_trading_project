# pairs_trading_project
This repository contains code for a pairs trading project that compares
traditional statistical arbitrage methods with machine learning approaches.
The project uses historical price data for S&P 500 stocks to construct
market-independent trading strategies and evaluate performance using
risk-adjusted metrics.

Data were obtained from Bloomberg.
